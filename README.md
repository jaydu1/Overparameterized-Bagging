# Overparameterized ensembling


This repository contains code and documentation for our research projects on overparameterized ensembling. Our project aims to (1) understand the behavior of implicit subsampling and explicit regularization, and (2) provide accurate and efficient cross-validation methods for ensemble learning, which also accommodate the overparameterized scenarios when the feature dimension is much larger than the sample size.

Our project website is available at [Github Pages](https://jaydu1.github.io/overparameterized-ensembling/).

# Ensemble cross-validation


This repository contains code and documentation for our research project on overparameterized ensemble cross-validation. Our project aims to provide accurate and efficient cross-validation methods for ensemble learning, which also accommodate the overparameterized scenarios when the feature dimension is much larger than the sample size.

Our project website is available at [Github Pages](https://jaydu1.github.io/overparameterized-ensembling/).
